# Software-Defined Networking (SDN) Introduction

## Overview
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an architectural approach that decouples network control from data forwarding, enabling programmable and flexible network management.

## Key Concepts

### Control Plane vs Data Plane
- **Control Plane**: Manages network decisions and routing logic
- **Data Plane**: Forwards actual data packets based on control plane decisions

### Core Components
- **Controller**: Centralized management of network behavior
- **OpenFlow Protocol**: Communication between controller and switches
- **Network Switches**: Programmable forwarding devices

## Benefits
- Centralized network management
- Dynamic traffic engineering
- Reduced operational complexity
- Cost efficiency through commodity hardware
- Rapid innovation and deployment

## Use Cases
- Data center networking
- Cloud infrastructure
- Network virtualization
- Traffic optimization
- Security policy enforcement

## Getting Started
- Learn OpenFlow protocol basics
- Explore SDN controllers (e.g., OpenDaylight, ONOS)
- Practice with mininet simulation environment
